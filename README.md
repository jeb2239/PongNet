## PONG::NET


clone this repository using
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:jeb2239/PongNet.git
```

I have only tested building and developing this project on ubuntu 20.04.
Would like to see if it could run on windows.

This has been developed using the clang compiler version 10
using C++20
```
sudo apt install clang-10
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-image-dev
sudo apt install libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
export CC=clang-10
export CXX=clang++-10
```
